You are part of a team that explores the bottom of the sea using a remotely controlled submersible probe. 
Develop a REST API that allows control of the probe from the surface using a set of interpreted controls.

Requirements
You have a defined grid representing the ocean floor where location can be identified using x/y co-ordinates
You are given an initial starting point (x, y) for the probe and the direction it is facing
The probe will receive a collection of commands
It should be able to:
Move forwards and backwards
Turn left and right
Stay on the grid
Avoid obstacles in the grid
Print a summary of the co-ordinates visited

Things we are looking for:
It is highly desired that the code has been test driven
Clean code
